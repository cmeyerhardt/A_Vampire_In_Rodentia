Player sucking blood = pretty self-explainatory, I made just two variations
PlayerStunningHunter = again, pretty self-explainatory. It's different from PlayerStunningGuard because of the metallic layer
HunterStunningPlayer = Hunter hitting player
HunterFootstep = each one of these is the sound of a single footstep
PlayerStunningGuard = as I've anticipated before this is for when the player stuns the guards
GuardStunningPlayer = guard hitting the player
GuardFootstep = each one of these is the sound of a single footstep. No metallic layer since guards don't wear armor
PlayerLoudFootstep = this has to play each time the player moves using SHIFT+WASD keys
PlayerSilentFootstep = this has to play when the player sneaks around
Hunter'sBolt = that's the sound of the bolt being shot from the crossbow
Update 05/28/2020
BoltImpactOnPlayer = as you (Carly) made me notice, we were lacking the sound of the arrow hitting the player, so here it is.
HunterBarking = since I don't have great barking sounds (and can't record my dog since there's too much noise at home to field record it), use this for the guards too. I'm not very happy with this solution, but I'd rather avoid going on freesound.org and having to credit other people.
MouseDying = pretty self-explainatory
Ambience = make this play as ambience noise. Set it in the audio mixer, I'll pass later and mix it to get the right amount of music and ambience noise to bring the scene to life
