Player sucking blood = pretty self-explainatory, I made just two variations
PlayerStunningHunter = again, pretty self-explainatory. It's different from PlayerStunningGuard because of the metallic layer
HunterStunningPlayer = Hunter hitting player
HunterFootstep = each one of these is the sound of a single footstep
PlayerStunningGuard = as I've anticipated before this is for when the player stuns the guards
GuardStunningPlayer = guard hitting the player
GuardFootstep = each one of these is the sound of a single footstep. No metallic layer since guards don't wear armor
PlayerLoudFootstep = this has to play each time the player moves using SHIFT+WASD keys
PlayerSilentFootstep = this has to play when the player sneaks around
Hunter'sBolt = that's the sound of the bolt being shot from the crossbow
